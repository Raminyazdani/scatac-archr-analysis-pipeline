Ramin Yazdani | scatac-archr-analysis-pipeline | main | feat(genes): Complete Phase 3 - gene activity and MAGIC imputation

Completed Phase 3 with full gene activity analysis and MAGIC-imputed visualizations:

1. **Gene Score Matrix**: Successfully computed chromatin accessibility-based gene activity scores for all genes, providing a proxy for gene expression directly from ATAC-seq data.

2. **MAGIC Imputation**: Applied MAGIC (Markov Affinity-based Graph Imputation) to denoise gene scores by leveraging cell-cell similarity. This dramatically improves visualization quality and reduces technical noise.

3. **Marker Gene Validation**: Generated UMAP plots for key PBMC marker genes (CD14, MS4A1, CD3E, CD8A, etc.) showing expected cell type-specific patterns:
   - CD14 high in monocytes
   - MS4A1 (CD20) high in B cells
   - CD3E/CD8A high in T cells
   
4. **Integration Preparation**: Gene scores are now ready for integration with scRNA-seq reference data (new_pbmc.rds) for precise cell type annotation.

Verified: Marker gene expression patterns match expected PBMC cell type distributions, confirming the quality of gene activity score computation and MAGIC imputation.
