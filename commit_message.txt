Ramin Yazdani | scatac-archr-analysis-pipeline | main | feat(config): Complete configuration with file paths and directory validation

Completed the configuration section by adding all file path definitions and directory creation logic. Uses portable path construction with getwd() and file.path() to ensure cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux). The configuration expects input data files: scbi_p2.zip (scATAC-seq fragments) and new_pbmc.rds (scRNA-seq reference for integration), and sets up data/ and results/ directories for intermediate and final outputs.

Added directory existence checks with automatic creation and working directory validation to prevent path-related errors during execution. The configuration is now complete and the pipeline is ready for implementation of analysis phases.

Verified: All paths use relative references, no hard-coded absolute paths that would break on other systems.
