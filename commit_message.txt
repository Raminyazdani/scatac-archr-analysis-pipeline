Ramin Yazdani | scatac-archr-analysis-pipeline | main | feat(deps): Add core library dependencies for scATAC-seq analysis

Added the analysis_pipeline.R script with core library imports required for single-cell ATAC-seq data analysis. This includes ArchR (the primary framework for scATAC-seq analysis), ggplot2 and patchwork for publication-quality visualizations, and tidyverse for data manipulation. The renv.lock file is updated to include all dependencies with locked versions, ensuring full reproducibility across different environments.

These libraries form the foundation of the analysis pipeline and must be loaded before any analytical work can begin. The commented-out installation code at the top provides guidance for setting up the environment from scratch, including the ArchR GitHub installation which requires the dev branch for the latest features.
