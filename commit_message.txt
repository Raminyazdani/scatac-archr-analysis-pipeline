Started implementing Harmony batch correction to remove sample-specific technical variation that was clearly visible in the UMAP colored by sample. Harmony is a fast and flexible algorithm that integrates multiple samples by identifying and removing batch-specific variation in the LSI embedding space while preserving biological differences between cell types.

The implementation begins with addHarmony() function setup but clustering has not yet been added. This is a work-in-progress commit to separate the batch correction logic from the clustering step, making the development process more reviewable and allowing independent testing of each component.

Next: Complete this phase by adding Seurat clustering after Harmony correction to identify biologically meaningful cell populations based on chromatin accessibility patterns.
