Started implementing scRNA-seq integration to transfer cell type labels from a well-annotated scRNA-seq PBMC reference dataset (new_pbmc.rds) to the scATAC-seq cells. This integration leverages gene activity scores computed from chromatin accessibility to find correspondence with actual gene expression profiles.

Progress made:
- addGeneIntegrationMatrix() setup to prepare gene scores for integration
- Beginning of integration with Seurat scRNA-seq reference object
- Framework for constrained integration ensuring biologically plausible cell type assignments

The integration uses canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to identify shared variation between scATAC gene scores and scRNA-seq expression, enabling accurate cell type label transfer. This is partially complete - the integration matrix is computed but transfer and validation steps are not yet implemented.

Next: Complete the integration by transferring cell type labels, generating integration UMAPs, and validating assignments against marker gene patterns observed in Phase 3.
