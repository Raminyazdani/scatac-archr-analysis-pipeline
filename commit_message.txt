Ramin Yazdani | scatac-archr-analysis-pipeline | main | feat(motifs): Fix TF motif analysis parameter and complete implementation

Fixed the TF motif analysis by correcting the parameter name from matrix = "MotifMatrix" to name = "MotifMatrix" in the getVarDeviations() call. This was a simple parameter name confusion - ArchR functions use 'name' to specify which matrix to operate on, while 'matrix' is used in some other contexts.

Complete TF motif enrichment analysis now includes:

1. **Motif Annotation**: All peaks annotated with TF binding motifs from JASPAR database (~750 TF motifs)

2. **Background Peaks**: Statistically matched background peak set accounting for GC content and accessibility to control for biases

3. **ChromVAR Deviations**: Computed per-cell deviation scores representing TF activity levels, accounting for technical variation and background signal

4. **Variable Motifs**: Identified TFs with significant activity variation across cell populations using proper 'name' parameter

5. **Motif Enrichment**: getEnrichedMotifs() identifies TFs with differential activity between clusters, revealing cell type-specific regulatory programs

Verified: TF motif analysis complete, generating enrichment plots and UMAP visualizations of TF activity patterns. Key lineage-specific TFs (e.g., SPI1 for myeloid, PAX5 for B cells) show expected patterns.
