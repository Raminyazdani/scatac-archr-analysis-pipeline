Started implementing Phase 3: gene activity analysis. Gene activity scores estimate gene expression levels from chromatin accessibility by aggregating ATAC-seq signal in gene promoters and gene bodies. This provides a proxy for gene expression that can be compared with scRNA-seq data and used for cell type annotation.

Current implementation includes:
- addGeneScoreMatrix() setup to compute accessibility-based gene scores
- Beginning of addGeneIntegrationMatrix() for scRNA-seq integration
- Initial marker gene identification framework

This is work in progress - the gene score matrix computation is initiated but MAGIC imputation and complete integration with the scRNA-seq reference (new_pbmc.rds) will be added in the next commit to complete this analytical phase.

Next: Complete gene activity analysis with MAGIC imputation for denoising and full scRNA-seq integration for cell type annotation.
