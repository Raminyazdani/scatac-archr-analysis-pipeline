Ramin Yazdani | scatac-archr-analysis-pipeline | main | WIP(peaks): Attempt peak calling - ERROR: pathToMacs2 not found

Attempted to add peak calling functionality but encountered a runtime error. Peak calling is essential for identifying reproducible accessible chromatin regions across cell populations, forming the basis for downstream analyses like differential accessibility and TF motif enrichment.

ERROR: "object 'pathToMacs2' not found" when calling addReproduciblePeakSet(). The issue is that the pathToMacs2 <- findMacs2() line is commented out at line 444, so the variable is undefined when later referenced.

Implementation includes:
- Pseudo-bulk replicates creation (groupBy = "Clusters")
- MACS2 path detection (COMMENTED OUT - causing the bug)
- addReproduciblePeakSet() call with standard parameters

Need to debug and fix the pathToMacs2 initialization before peak calling can proceed.

BUG LOCATION: Line 444 - pathToMacs2 <- findMacs2() is commented out
IMPACT: Cannot complete peak calling, blocking all downstream peak-based analyses
