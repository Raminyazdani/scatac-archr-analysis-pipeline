Ramin Yazdani | scatac-archr-analysis-pipeline | main | WIP(preprocess): Begin Phase 1 - preprocessing and QC setup

Started implementing Phase 1 of the analysis pipeline: preprocessing and quality control. This includes data extraction from the ZIP archive, genome annotation setup (hg38), and the beginning of Arrow file creation from fragment files. Arrow files are ArchR's optimized format for efficient single-cell data storage and access.

The code sets up genome annotation, extracts fragment files, and begins the addArchRGenome and createArrowFiles functions but is not yet complete. Quality control thresholds (TSS enrichment, fragment counts) and doublet detection will be added in the next commit to complete this phase.

Work in progress - this step represents the initial scaffolding for preprocessing before adding the full QC pipeline.
