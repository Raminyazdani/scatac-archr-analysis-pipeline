Started implementing Phase 4: differential accessibility and advanced analyses. This phase identifies peaks with significantly different accessibility between cell populations, revealing cell type-specific regulatory elements.

Progress includes:
- getMarkerFeatures() for differential peak accessibility between clusters
- Beginning of MA plots and volcano plots for visualization
- Framework for TF motif enrichment in differential peaks
- Setup for peak-to-gene linkage analysis

Differential accessibility testing uses statistical methods to identify peaks that are significantly more accessible in one cluster versus others, accounting for multiple testing. These differential peaks often contain cell type-specific enhancers and regulatory elements.

Partial implementation - the differential testing framework is in place but visualization code, TF enrichment in differential peaks, and peak-to-gene correlation analyses are not yet complete. These advanced features require the differential testing results to be finalized first.

Next: Complete differential visualization, add TF footprinting, and implement co-accessibility analysis to identify regulatory networks.
