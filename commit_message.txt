Continued Phase 3 gene activity analysis by adding MAGIC (Markov Affinity-based Graph Imputation of Cells) imputation to denoise gene activity scores. MAGIC leverages the manifold structure of the data to smooth gene activity values, improving signal-to-noise ratio for visualization and interpretation.

Progress made:
- Successfully computed gene score matrices with addGeneScoreMatrix()
- Started MAGIC imputation setup with addImputeWeights()
- Beginning of marker gene visualization framework

However, the marker gene visualization section is incomplete - plotting code for CD14, MS4A1, and other key marker genes is not yet functional. These visualizations are critical for validating cell type assignments and ensuring the gene activity scores accurately reflect biology.

Next commit: Complete marker gene visualizations and verify that gene activity patterns match expected cell type-specific expression profiles before proceeding to TF motif analysis.
