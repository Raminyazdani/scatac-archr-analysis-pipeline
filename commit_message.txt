Ramin Yazdani | scatac-archr-analysis-pipeline | main | feat(preprocess): Complete Phase 1 - preprocessing and quality control

Completed the full preprocessing and quality control pipeline. This critical phase processes raw scATAC-seq fragment files into quality-filtered Arrow files ready for downstream analysis. Key accomplishments:

1. **Arrow File Creation**: Converts fragment files to ArchR's efficient Arrow format with automatic cell barcode handling and filtering based on TSS enrichment (>4) and fragment counts (>1000).

2. **Doublet Detection**: Implements ArchR's doublet identification algorithm to remove technical artifacts where two cells are captured in the same droplet, which would confound downstream clustering.

3. **Quality Visualizations**: Generates comprehensive QC plots including fragment size distributions (should show nucleosome banding pattern), TSS enrichment profiles, and scatter plots correlating TSS vs fragment count metrics.

4. **ArchR Project Creation**: Initializes the ArchR project object with filtered high-quality cells, setting the foundation for all subsequent analyses.

Verified: QC thresholds (TSS>8, fragments>1000 for final filtering) ensure only high-quality cells pass to downstream analysis, critical for reliable biological interpretation.
