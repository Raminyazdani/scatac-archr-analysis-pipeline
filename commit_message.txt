Ramin Yazdani | scatac-archr-analysis-pipeline | main | feat(peaks): Fix peak calling by uncommenting pathToMacs2 line

Fixed the peak calling bug by uncommenting the pathToMacs2 <- findMacs2() line at line 444. This was a simple oversight during testing - the line was temporarily commented out to test other parts of the pipeline and was not uncommented before committing.

Peak calling now works correctly:
1. **MACS2 Detection**: findMacs2() successfully locates the MACS2 installation
2. **Reproducible Peak Set**: addReproduciblePeakSet() identifies peaks present in multiple pseudo-bulk replicates, ensuring robustness
3. **Peak Matrix**: addPeakMatrix() creates a peak-by-cell matrix for quantitative analysis
4. **Marker Peaks**: getMarkerFeatures() identifies cluster-specific accessible peaks for cell type characterization

The complete peak calling pipeline is now functional and produces a comprehensive peak matrix ready for downstream analyses like marker identification, differential accessibility, and TF motif enrichment.

Verified: Peak calling completed successfully, marker peaks identified for each cluster.
