Ramin Yazdani | scatac-archr-analysis-pipeline | main | feat(docs): Add comprehensive portfolio documentation

Added complete portfolio-ready documentation to transform this from an academic project into a professional showcase:

1. **project_identity.md**: Defines the project's professional identity with display title, tagline, technical stack, and comprehensive overview of inputs/outputs

2. **README.md**: Complete rewrite from academic to professional format including:
   - Professional badges (R, ArchR, Bioconductor)
   - Comprehensive overview of features and capabilities
   - Detailed installation instructions (renv and manual)
   - Usage guide with quick start and configuration
   - Data requirements specification
   - Complete output structure documentation
   - Troubleshooting section for common issues
   - Citation guidelines

3. **report.md**: Portfolio transformation execution log documenting all changes made to professionalize the project

4. **Ledgers**: suggestion.txt and suggestions_done.txt tracking all academic→portfolio transformations

Changes removed all academic traces (University Project, Week 1/2/3, Project 2 references) and replaced with professional Phase-based structure. The documentation is now portfolio-grade and suitable for professional presentation.
