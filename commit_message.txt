Ramin Yazdani | scatac-archr-analysis-pipeline | main | feat(analysis): Complete full analysis pipeline implementation

Completed the entire analysis pipeline with all advanced features:

1. **Differential Accessibility**: Full implementation with MA plots, volcano plots, and marker peak heatmaps showing cluster-specific chromatin accessibility patterns

2. **TF Footprinting**: Added getFootprints() with Tn5 bias correction to visualize actual TF binding patterns within accessible peaks, distinguishing bound from unbound motif instances

3. **Peak-to-Gene Linkage**: Implemented addPeak2GeneLinks() using correlation between peak accessibility and gene activity scores to identify enhancer-gene regulatory relationships

4. **Co-accessibility Analysis**: Added addCoAccessibility() to discover peaks that are coordinately regulated, revealing regulatory modules and long-range chromatin interactions

5. **Browser Tracks**: Generated genome browser visualization tracks for key marker genes (CD14, MS4A1, CD3E) showing accessibility patterns with peak annotations

All major analyses are now complete. The pipeline produces a comprehensive analysis from raw fragments to biological insights including cell type identification, regulatory element discovery, TF activity profiling, and gene regulatory network inference.

The analysis results are reproducible and ready for interpretation and publication.
