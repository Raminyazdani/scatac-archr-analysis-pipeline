Ramin Yazdani | scatac-archr-analysis-pipeline | main | WIP(config): Set up basic configuration parameters

Added initial configuration section to the analysis pipeline with random seeding and thread count detection. The set.seed(1) ensures reproducibility of stochastic algorithms used throughout the pipeline (LSI, UMAP, clustering). Thread count is automatically detected using parallel::detectCores(), leaving 2 cores free for system processes to maintain responsiveness during long-running analyses.

This is the first part of the configuration setup. File paths and directory structure will be added in the next commit to keep changes focused and reviewable.
