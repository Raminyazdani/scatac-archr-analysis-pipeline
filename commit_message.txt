Ramin Yazdani | scatac-archr-analysis-pipeline | main | feat(dimreduce): Implement Iterative LSI for dimensionality reduction

Implemented Iterative Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), a specialized dimensionality reduction technique optimized for scATAC-seq data. LSI is preferred over PCA for sparse chromatin accessibility data because it better captures the binary nature (accessible vs inaccessible) of ATAC-seq measurements.

The implementation uses 4 iterations of LSI with 30 dimensions, which empirically balances computational efficiency with preservation of biological variation. Each iteration refines the feature selection and LSI projection, progressively improving the representation of cellular heterogeneity.

This dimensionality reduction is crucial for all downstream analyses - clustering, UMAP visualization, and cell type identification all depend on a quality LSI projection that captures true biological variation while removing technical noise.

Next step: Add UMAP embedding for 2D visualization of the LSI-reduced data space.
