Ramin Yazdani | scatac-archr-analysis-pipeline | main | feat(viz): Add UMAP embedding and initial visualizations

Added UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) embedding to project the high-dimensional LSI space into 2D for visualization. UMAP preserves both local and global structure of the data, making it ideal for identifying cell clusters and understanding relationships between cell types.

Generated multiple UMAP visualizations colored by different metadata:
- Sample: Reveals batch effects and technical variation between samples
- TSS Enrichment: Shows quality distribution across cells (high TSS = good quality)
- Fragment Count: Indicates sequencing depth per cell
- nFrags bins: Categorized view of fragment count distribution

These initial visualizations revealed clear batch effects where cells cluster primarily by sample rather than by cell type, indicating the need for batch correction. This is a common issue in multi-sample scATAC-seq experiments and will be addressed with Harmony integration in the next phase.

Next: Implement Harmony batch correction to remove sample-specific technical variation while preserving biological differences.
